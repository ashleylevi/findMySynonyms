# findMySynonyms

## findMySynonyms is my first attempt at building an application with Vue. It is a single-page application that allows users to find synonyms for a word they search. Additionally, the synonyms are clickable. When one is clicked synonyms will display for that new word.

## Project setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashleylevi/findMySynonyms.git
```
```
cd vue-app
```
```
$ npm install
```
```
$ npm run serve
```
